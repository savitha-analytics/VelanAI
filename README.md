# 🌿 Leaf Disease Detection using CNN + Vision Transformer

This project implements a deep learning–based system for classifying common wheat leaf diseases using a hybrid **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** and **Vision Transformer (ViT)** architecture. It provides a complete pipeline—from dataset preparation and model training to evaluation, Grad-CAM visualization, and deployment via a Flask web application.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

This hybrid architecture leverages the strengths of both CNNs and Vision Transformers:

- **CNN:** Extracts low-level spatial features and acts as a tokenization layer.
- **ViT:** Captures global dependencies using self-attention mechanisms.
- **Output:** Multi-class classification via softmax.

**Task Type:** Multi-class image classification  
**Domain:** Wheat leaf disease detection
